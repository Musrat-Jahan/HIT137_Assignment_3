## Assignment_3
This assignment encompasses the creation of a Tkinter application and a 2D side-scrolling game, along with setting up a GitHub repository for group collaboration. The goals include:

1. Building a Tkinter application using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
2. Developing a simple side-scrolling 2D game using Pygame.
3. Establishing a public GitHub repository for team contributions and documentation.

### Question 1: Tkinter Application Development
The first task involves creating a Tkinter application that utilizes various OOP concepts:

- **Multiple Inheritance**: Combining functionalities of multiple classes into a single class to promote code reusability.
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data safe by restricting access to certain components of the application.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
- **Method Overriding**: Redefining a method in a derived class to change its behavior.

#### Application Example
A potential application is a simple image classification tool that uses pre-trained AI models. The application should:

1. Allow users to upload an image.
2. Send the image data to an AI model for classification.
3. Display the classification results on the interface.

### Question 2: Pygame Side-Scrolling Game
The second task is to create a side-scrolling 2D game using Pygame, featuring:

- **Player Class**: Controls player movements, speed, jump, health, and lives.
- **Projectile Class**: Manages projectiles, including their speed and damage.
- **Enemy Class**: Defines enemy behavior and properties.
- **Collectible Class**: Implements health boosts and extra lives.
- **Level Design**: Creates three distinct levels, including a boss enemy.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks defeated enemies and collected items.
- **Game Over Screen**: Provides options to restart the game.

#### Game feature:
- Smooth character movements.
- Enemy AI for realistic interactions.
- A scoring and health system for enhanced gameplay.

### Question 3: GitHub Repository Setup
The final task is to create a public GitHub repository for group collaboration:

**Repository Creation**: Establish a public repository for the assignment and ensure it is accessible to all group members.

**Adding Members**: Invite group members to the repository, ensuring they have permissions to contribute.

**Documentation of Contributions**: Use descriptive commit messages and document all changes in the repository to reflect team efforts.

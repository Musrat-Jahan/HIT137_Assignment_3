## Assignment_3
This assignment encompasses the creation of a Tkinter application and a 2D side-scrolling game, along with setting up a GitHub repository for group collaboration. The goals include:

1. Building a Tkinter application using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
2. Developing a simple side-scrolling 2D game using Pygame.
3. Establishing a public GitHub repository for team contributions and documentation.

### Question 1: Tkinter Application Development
The first task involves creating a Tkinter application that utilizes various OOP concepts:

- **Multiple Inheritance**: Combining functionalities of multiple classes into a single class to promote code reusability.
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data safe by restricting access to certain components of the application.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
- **Method Overriding**: Redefining a method in a derived class to change its behavior.

### Question 2: Pygame Side-Scrolling Game

## Overview
This is a 2D side-scrolling game built with Python and Pygame. The player controls a character that can move, jump, and shoot projectiles. The game features multiple levels, enemy AI, collectibles, and a scoring system based on the number of enemies defeated.

The objective is to defeat all enemies in each level and progress through 3 levels. If the player loses all lives, the game is over, but you can restart at any time.

## Features
- **Player** character that can move, jump, and shoot projectiles.
- **Enemies** that move randomly and need to be defeated.
- **Collectibles** that increase player health and provide extra lives.
- **Health and Life System** for the player.
- **Multiple Levels** with increasing difficulty.
- **Game Over Screen** showing the number of enemies killed and allowing the player to restart or quit.
- **Dynamic Camera** that follows the player smoothly.
  
## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pygame**: This game is built using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.

### Installation
1. Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   
### Steps Recap:
1. **Installation**: Python and Pygame must be installed.
2. **Running the Game**: Download the files, navigate to the folder, and run `python main.py`.
3. **Gameplay Instructions**: Explains how to play, including movement, jumping, shooting, collecting items, and advancing levels.
4. **Video Demo**: A video demo [demo.mp4](https://github.com/Musrat-Jahan/HIT137_Assignment_3/raw/main/demo.mp4) is linked to show the gameplay.


### Question 3: GitHub Repository Setup
The final task is to create a public GitHub repository for group collaboration:

**Repository Creation**: Establish a public repository for the assignment and ensure it is accessible to all group members.

**Adding Members**: Invite group members to the repository, ensuring they have permissions to contribute.

**Documentation of Contributions**: Use descriptive commit messages and document all changes in the repository to reflect team efforts.
